We were ambushed by strange undulating shapes, 2 small entities that I cannot hope to describe and a third, much larger beast.  Poor Moira was crushed into a pulp as Therion defended her - he soon lost his arm and his wits left him, \u201cShambler! Shambler!\u201d he kept shrieking as Raeven yanked him to flee.
